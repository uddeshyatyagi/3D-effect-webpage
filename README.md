# 3D-effect-webpage
We have used 3d effect animation when we scroll down to bottom of the webpage.
Anyone willing to contribute to it or want to help,
making this webpage better is warm heartedly welcome.
Problem with it is,it uses CDN,you might require internet connection to load the content,that's what hapened with me.

Things that user can do:
1.create issue with label if find something ain't working,there is a bug or anything like that
2.create pull requests,to merge their code in the master branch or in the main repository.
3.fork the respository to actually see how things are really working

Happing coding :)
